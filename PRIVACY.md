- **Book Covers**: Extracted cover images from your eBooks
- **Reading Preferences**: Themes, fonts, text size, spacing, and other customization settings

- We do **NOT** require account creation or login

## Third-Party Services

### Dictionary API

When you use the "Define" feature for word lookup, LapBook queries the **Free Dictionary API** (https://dictionaryapi.dev/). This service:
- Receives only the specific word you want to define
- Does NOT receive any personal information
- Is a free, open-source service

### Auto-Update Check

LapBook checks for updates by querying GitHub Releases:
- Only checks version numbers
- Does NOT send any personal information
- Can be disabled by not using "Check for Updates"

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your data security depends on your device security
- We recommend keeping your device password-protected
- Regular backups of your device will protect your LapBook data

## Data Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export**: Your library data is stored in JSON format at `%APPDATA%\lapbook\library.json`
- **Delete**: Uninstalling LapBook or deleting the data folder removes all app data
- **Backup**: You can manually backup the `%APPDATA%\lapbook\` folder

## Children's Privacy

LapBook does not collect any personal information and is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app's updated version with a new "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
